          <p>I once bought new notebooks. Thought I’d fill them with poems and plans. They’re still blank. I sleep beside them sometimes as if they’ll write my healing for me.</p>
          <p class="alt">I made a playlist called <b>“better days.”</b> It stops at track three. I haven’t pressed play in months. Some songs are too honest.</p>
          <p>I promised I’d visit. Said we’d laugh till sunrise, like we used to. But I kept choosing sleep over people, distance over effort. I let the silence win.</p>
          <p class="alt">I typed out a message three paragraphs long. It said everything. I backspaced it all. No one needs to carry my chaos.</p>
          <p>I told them I was catching up on shows, writing again. But the truth? I just laid there, staring at the ceiling cracks, connecting them like constellations of failure.</p>
          <p class="alt italic">I keep telling myself I’ll come back to the people, the dreams, the version of me I abandoned. But most nights, I just scroll and pretend I’m okay with fading quietly.</p>

        <div class="footer-text">
          Notebooks are tombstones of things I never said. Playlists are eulogies for who I used to be. Messages are confessions I couldn’t deliver. Silence is my cruelest companion. Memories are ghosts I sleep beside.
